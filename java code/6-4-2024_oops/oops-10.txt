/******************************************************************************

Design a Java program to create a base class named "Vehicle" with methods startEngine() and stopEngine().
Develop subclasses "Car" and "Motorcycle" that inherit from Vehicle.
Override the startEngine() and stopEngine() methods in each subclass to customize engine start and stop behaviors.
